# LASD

This repo contains the following C libraries:
- Binary Search Trees: both iterative and recursive;
- Heap trees;
- Graphs;
- Mazes;
- Final project: a maze game;

### Perfection?
All the libraries, final project included, are **NOT** perfect! No one *should* have memory leaks, but there could be done a lot of improvements.
As for the first libriaries, there are a lot of things that I don't agree anymore, but for time reasons I left the code as it is. As for the final project, I think that its code is good.

### Linux
All the libraries, final project included, were developed on Linux (latest *gcc* version).

### Valgrind!
Valgrind is a powerful tool. It was mainly used to find memory leaks. Read more [here](http://valgrind.org/).
